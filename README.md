## What CarVita do?

✅ **Visualize Your Vehicle's Status:** A clear dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of your vehicles and the most urgent upcoming services.

✅ **Track Multiple Vehicles:** Manage all your cars, motorcycles, or other vehicles in one place.

✅ **Create Custom Maintenance Plans:** Input your vehicle manufacturer's recommended service schedule (both time and mileage intervals, including first service requirements) to create a plan tailored specifically to your vehicle.

✅ **Log Every Service:** Keep a detailed digital history of all maintenance performed, including date, mileage, items serviced, costs, and notes.

✅ **Get Predictions:** Calculates upcoming maintenance tasks for each item in your plan, considering both time and mileage cycles, and even predicts due dates based on your vehicle's usage patterns.

✅ **Stay Alert with Reminders:** Receive timely local notifications for upcoming services, so you can schedule appointments without stress.
